We present a collection of heuristics and simple tests for evaluating the quality of a projection-based virtual reality display. A typical VR system includes numerous potential sources of error. By understanding the characteristics of a correctly working system, and the types of errors that are likely to occur, users can quickly determine if their display is inaccurate and what components may need correction.
