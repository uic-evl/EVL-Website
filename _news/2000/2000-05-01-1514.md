Paul Neumann&rsquo;s PH.D. Dissertation - Submitted as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science in the Graduate College of the University of Illinois at Chicago, 2000.<br><br>

This project demonstrates the design and practical scientific use of an anatomically realistic computer model of a human eye in a virtual environment. Users are able to explore and interact with the eye&rsquo;s components to discover their characteristics. The model will eventually be used to educate students on the eye&rsquo;s geometry and will allow them to simulate common pre-surgical procedures.
