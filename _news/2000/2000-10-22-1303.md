This paper describes the design and implementation of CAVERNsoft G2, a toolkit for building collaborative virtual reality applications. G2&rsquo;s special emphasis is on providing the tools to support high-performance computing and data intensive systems that are coupled to collaborative, immersive environments.<br><br>

This paper describes G2&rsquo;s broad range of services, and demonstrates how they are currently being used in a collaborative volume visualization application.
