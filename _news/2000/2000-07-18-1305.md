The goal of the AccessBot&trade; project is to provide a new form of access for the disabled that integrates teleconferencing with life-sized display screens, robotics and high speed networking, to create a virtual presence for the handicapped participant at meetings. The use of a life-sized display and high-fidelity video and audio conferencing rather than existing conference room meeting systems is to ensure that the handicapped participant commands as equal a presence as the regular participants in the meeting. The use of a zoom / pan / tilt camera empowers the handicapped participant with capabilities beyond what is &ldquo;humanly&rdquo; possible - giving them a &ldquo;bionic&rdquo; eye with which they can see far greater distances.<br><br>

This paper will describe the implementation of the AccessBot and the lessons learned from its deployment at the SC98 Conference in Orlando, Florida; and at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications&rsquo; ACCESS Center in Washington D.C.
