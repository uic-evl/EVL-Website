The work in this paper describes a preliminary observational study conducted on users of CAVE6D, a collaborative CAVE-based virtual reality tool for visualizing multivariate oceanographic data sets. CAVE6D presents the concpet of multiple perspectives by allowing participants to customize their views while working collaboratively and supporting the views either privately or globally. The goal of this study is to understand how tele-immmersed participants cooperate when presented with multiple perspectives and to explore ways to leverage these perspectives to allow scientists to more rapidly interpret massive multi-dimensional data sets.
