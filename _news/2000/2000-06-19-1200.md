The PARIS (Personal Augmented Reality Immersive System) is a new VR display device that was first prototyped as a virtual device in a CAVE&reg; to aid in the development process. This initial prototyping in VR allowed the designers to save time and money, and to garner valuable feedback from prospective users, before finally committing the design to hardware.
