Sometimes scientists would like to stick their heads into interesting parts of their data sets and look around, but they are hampered by the &ldquo;outside-looking-in&rdquo; aspect of workstation-based visualization. At the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago, we are attempting to break some of the visualization barriers with a distributed computing and visualization environment developed using the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) virtual reality theater. In particular, we&rsquo;re trying to provide physicists and astrophysicists at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) a new vehicle for scientific discovery.<br><br>

This paper describes The Cosmic Worm, a CAVE-based distributed computing and visualization package that enables NCSA scientists to examine astrophysics and relativity data in an interactive, immersive environment.
