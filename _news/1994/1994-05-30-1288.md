Scientific databases contain very large amounts of data accessed by investigators from many disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new interface to scientific databases: the SANDBOX: Scientists Accessing Necessary Data Based On eXperimentation. Much of the data that is stored in scientific databases is collected through experimentation. The SANDBOX is a virtual reality tool which allows an investigator to &ldquo;recreate&rdquo; the original experiment, collecting data from the scientific database in much the same way that the original data was collected. The investigator places virtual instruments into a virtual environment and collects data from the scientific database without ever typing in a query. These instruments give feedback, allowing the user to browse through available data of any type. We have implemented a prototype of the SANDBOX on a subset of NASA&rsquo;s FIFE scientific database using the CAVE virtual reality theatre.
