This paper presents a multidisciplinary collaboration between neurobiologists, databases, visualization and human / computer interaction specialists, in the design of a database for the storage of simulation models from Computational Neuroscience. The design consists of using the neural simulation system GENESIS, as the underlying model for the scientific database. In addition, we briefly describe some of our preliminary work in using Virtual Reality interfaces to access scientific databases.
