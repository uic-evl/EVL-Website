The annual Supercomputing conference provides computational scientists and engineers with a global forum for showcasing their research. Scientists transport parts of their labs to the conference site or connect to their labs over high-speed networks to communicate, to educate, and to learn from one another. This catalog is an attempt to capture all the planning, teamwork, cooperation, and especially the interactive, real-time presentations of two unique SC &rsquo;95 conference events: the GII Testbed and the HPC Challenge demonstrations, which run over the I-WAY, a national-scale, applications-focused, community-based ATM network.
