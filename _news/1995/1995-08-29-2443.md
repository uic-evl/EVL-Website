The barrier strip strip method cuts a predetermined number of different views of an object into vertical columns, interleaves the columns on a transparency, and positions them behind the slits of a barrier strip that is in a fixed position.

There is disclosed a method of making autostereo­graphic images of an object, comprising the steps of inputting to a computer a predetermined number of planar images of the object, each of the planar images being a view of the object, from one of the predetermined number of different viewpoints; interleaving the predetermined number of planar images in the com­puter; and printing the interleaved images with a high­resolution output imaging device on a spacer, a selected edge of each interleaved image being aligned with a predetermined direction on the spacer.<br><br>
Also disclosed is an apparatus for making autostereo­graphic images of an object, comprising a device for generating a predetermined number of planar images of the object, each planar image being a view of the object from one of the predetermined number of different viewpoints; a computer, the computer interleaving the predetermined number of planar images; and a high­resolution output imaging device, the output imaging device being in communication with the computer, for printing the interleaved images on a transparent spacer with selected edges of the images being aligned with a predetermined direction.<br><br>
Also disclosed is an autostereograph, comprising a transparent spacer; a predetermined number of planar images, the planar images being views of an object from the predetermined number of different viewpoints and being interleaved in strips and printed on a side of the spacer; and a device for viewing predetermined ones of the strips according to an observation position, the viewing means being disposed on the opposite side of the spacer.
