This paper describes a system for calibrating the position component of a 6-degree-of-freedom magnetic tracker by comparing the output with a custom-built ultrasonic measuring system. A look-up table, created from the collected difference data, is used to interpolate for corrected values. The error of the resulting corrected magnetic tracker position is measured to be less than 5% over the calibrated range.
