This paper describes how a requirement for stereovision can impact virtual environment characteristics and performance. Human visual anomalies that result from the limitations of producing congruent visual cues are described along with possible solutions. The CAVE is used as a model environment that implements stereovision to provide users with visual contact with objects at arms&rsquo; length.
