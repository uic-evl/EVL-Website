We present the design and development of Corelyzer, an initial visual core description tool with collaboration and annotation features. Corelyzer belongs to the larger CoreWall suite of tools used to process, visualize and manage high-resolution core images gathered during core drilling expeditions. We have been observing scientists using Corelyzer over several drilling expeditions to better understand how to integrate it into core drilling workflows.<br><br>

CoreWall is designed to aid real-time stratigraphic correlation, initial core description and data visualization for various core-drilling communities.<br><br>

Corelyzer is CoreWall&rsquo;s initial visual core description tool that allows scientists to interact with and scale huge data visualizations on a desktop workstation connected to one or more monitors in order to collaborate more effectively. The user interface and data source connections were developed using Java, and the efficient rendering component was developed using OpenGL.
