Client-Server Pair Abstraction

<em>LambdaRAM</em> is a high-performance, multi-dimensional, wide-area, distributed cache that takes advantage of massively available memory from multiple clusters interconnected by ultra high-speed networking to provide data-intensive scientific applications with rapid access to both local and remote data without suffering the latency bottlenecks often associated with large storage systems and wide-area data access.<br><br>

<em>LambdaRAM</em> has been demonstrated to yield significant performance speed-ups for Geophysical and Bioscience applications accessing extremely large datasets. Currently, <em>LambdaRAM</em> is being integrated by NASA for the Modeling, Analysis and Prediction (MAP) Program applications to study tropical cyclones. Formal verification of LambdaRAM is important to NASA to ensure that <em>LambdaRAM</em> operates reliably in real-time mission critical deployments.<br><br>

We present our preliminary steps towards full formal verification of <em>LambdaRAM</em>.  We first give an abstract description of the system and then verify several of its properties. Most of the proofs are accomplished by automatic techniques, while some require deductive steps.
