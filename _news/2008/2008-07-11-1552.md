Students investigate WallCology and tally their results

Several simulation environments exist that create a place in which students can explore scientific phenomena. In this paper, we propose design guidelines for creating a classroom environment that puts scientific concepts directly into that physical space. We examine the results of two implementations of WallCology, which we characterize as an embedded phenomenon, in elementary and middle school classrooms. Several instances of innovative student inquiry emerged as a result of the design features. Along with the results of learning, we look at the relationship between an embodied approach to design and the imaginative role of the student.<br><br>
