The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) and several of its collaborators are already putting in place a Global Cyber-Commons, a networked set of instructional spaces with access to the same cyberinfrastructure (CI) based resources as research laboratories, as well as additional synchronous and asynchronous tools, called Cyber-Mashups, to enable and encourage computer-science and computational-science graduate and undergraduate student use. Participating faculty use Cyber-Commons to teach CI-based classes, and students use CI to implement class projects.
