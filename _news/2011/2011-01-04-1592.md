This paper describes case studies and lessons learned from cross-cultural collaborations. A computer scientist was embedded within domain settings to design and develop systems for geological core drilling and medical hand-off. While these domains seem diverge and have different purposes and workflows, one common theme emerged from reflection analysis. They all heavily depends on &ldquo;observable artifacts&rdquo; in early if not all iterations of design and development cycles. Utilizing the common and different signature characteristics would help identifying and taking the proper strategies for different phases of future scientific collaboration projects.
