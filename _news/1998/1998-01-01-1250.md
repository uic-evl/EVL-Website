&ldquo;Strait Dope&rdquo; is a CAVE or ImmersaDesk virtual environment that emphasizes participant interaction. &ldquo;Strait Dope&rdquo; colors thought and decision making by presenting unfamiliar elements in settings which operate under an alternate logic. Participants discover their own path to confront a subversive world of colors, characters, voices and noises.
