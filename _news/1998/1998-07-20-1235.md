Art will become innovative in the medium of virtual environments when the spectator abandons the act of mere viewing, transcends simple narrative participation and bursts into the scene as an active creator. &ldquo;Strait Dope&rdquo; is a CAVE virtual art environment that offers an opportunity to participate in a room size projective construction. The nonlinear nonhierarchical structure of &ldquo;Strait Dope&rdquo; stages a stream of consciousness movement that is simultaneously subversive and confrontational.
