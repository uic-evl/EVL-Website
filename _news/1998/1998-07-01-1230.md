Tele-Immersion, the union of networked virtual reality and video to support collaboration among scientists, engineers, and educators, is an important element in the computing information infrastructure envisioned by the National Computational Science Alliance. Tele-Immersion will allow people from around the world to casually enter a shared virtual environment, manipulate that environment - whether its a scientific simulation or a design space, and engage in discourse with their collaborators.
