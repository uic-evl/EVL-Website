This is a survey of several pieces that showed in the Touchware Gallery at SIGGRAPH 98, and were put in the category of interactive installation. I&rsquo;m interested in discussing the issues and problems that these artists are dealing with by making, or because they make, interactive work, especially since I am in the process of making my own interactive art piece. The pieces were, Case Study 309, Tammy Knipp; Telematic Vision, Paul Sermon; WorldSkin, Maurice Benayoun; Items 1-2000, Paul Vanouse; The Bush Soul, Rebecca Allen and the Emergence Team; and Iconica, Troy Innocent. My piece is called The Thing Growing.
