This paper describes the construction of a single screen, projection-based VR display using commodity, or otherwise low-cost, components. The display is based on Linux PCs, and uses polarized stereo. Our aim is to create a system that is accessible to the many museums and schools that do not have large budgets for exploring new technology. In constructing this system we have been evaluating a number of options for the screens, projectors, and computer hardware.
