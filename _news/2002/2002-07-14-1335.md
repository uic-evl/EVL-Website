<em>Alive on the Grid</em> is a collection of virtual art worlds where local and distant participants alike can interact in shared virtual spaces. Enabled by the Grid - collections of networks, computers and virtual reality displays that span the globe - users interact with one another and the models contained within each piece. This paper discusses both the artistic and technical aspects of <em>Alive on the Grid</em>.
