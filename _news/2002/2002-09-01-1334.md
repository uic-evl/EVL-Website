High speed bulk data transfer is an important part of many data-intensive scientific applications. This paper describes an aggressive bulk data transfer scheme, called Reliable Blast UDP (RBUDP), intended for extremely high bandwidth, dedicated - or Quality-of-Service - enabled networks, such as optically switched networks.<br><br>

This paper also provides an analytical model to predict RBUDP&rsquo;s performance and compares the results of our model against our implementation of RBUDP. Our results show that RBUDP performs extremely efficiently over high speed dedicated networks and our model is able to provide good estimates of its performance.
