EVL&rsquo;s TeraVision is a real-time method to distribute visual imagery from any PC graphics platform over the Access Grid that requires no setup, software, or hardware changes to the user&rsquo;s computer. TeraVision&rsquo;s goal is to provide one solution for what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Docking Problem / Display Pushing Problem&rdquo; in Advanced Collaborative Environments such as the AccessGrid. That is, to provide a means for anyone on the Access Grid to plug-in, for example their laptop, and to deliver a presentation without having to install or configure any software, or distribute any of the data files, in advance.
