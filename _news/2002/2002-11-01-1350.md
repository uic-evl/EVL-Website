Amplified Collaboration Environments are distributed extensions of traditional warrooms or project-rooms, in which a group of people collect to intensely solve a problem together. Prior work in project-rooms has been mainly restricted to co-located groups. The technology is now available to realize affordable collaboratoriums that can support intensive work between distributed organizations. This paper describes the Continuum, an Amplified Collaboration Environment specifically targeted for supporting collaborative scientific investigation.
