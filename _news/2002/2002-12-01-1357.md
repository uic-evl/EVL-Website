**Spale, A.**
- PDF: [panels-tools-views-paper.pdf](/documents/panels-tools-views-paper.pdf)
Panels, Tools, and Views (PTV) is a conceptual framework for providing a visual programming environment. This framework seeks to map programming language API to various GUI components in the visual environment. Just as GUIs have allowed people to work in a wide variety of domains without having to write text-based programs to accomplish their tasks, the PTV framework seeks to lessen the effort needed for people to write computer programs.
