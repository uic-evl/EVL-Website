Visual interface of aircraft engine simulation analysis.

Aircraft engines emit particulates that alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere and perturb the Earthâ€™s radiation budget by creating additional ice clouds in the form of condensation trails called contrails. We propose a multi-scale visual computing system that will assist in defining contrail features with parameter analysis for computer-generated aircraft engine simulations. These simulations are computationally intensive and rely on high-performance computing (HPC) solutions. Our multi-linked visual system seeks to help in the identification of the formation and evolution of contrails and in the identification of contrail-related spatial features from the simulation workflow.
