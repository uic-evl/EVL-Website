This paper describes the design and implementation of two tele-immersive applications, CVD and CAVE6D, both designed to support collaborative knowledge discovery from large multidimensional datasets. CVD integrates the capabilities of two existing VR applications, CAVE6D and Virtual Director, in order to provide immersive experiences of distributed data using high performance networks and interactive hardware and software. CAVE6D is similar in function yet is tightly integrated with the CAVERNsoft toolkit so as to provide access to remote computational platforms and databases.
