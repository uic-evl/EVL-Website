The Round Earth Project is investigating how virtual reality technology can be used to help teach concepts that are counter-intuitive to a learner&rsquo;s currently held mental model. Virtual reality can be used to provide an alternative cognitive starting point that does not carry the baggage of past experiences. In particular this paper describes our work in comparing two strategies for teaching young children that the Earth is spherical when their everyday experiences tell them it is flat.
