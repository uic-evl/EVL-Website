(art)n Laboratory and the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago have collaborated on the development of the first real-time, stereoscopic hardcopy output of virtual reality applications - the ImmersaGram (IGram). The results of this new technology directly address a broad range of information visualization issues along a wide spectrum of disciplines from art, architecture, and science, to medicine, engineering and education.
