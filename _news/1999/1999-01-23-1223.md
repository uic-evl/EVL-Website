This paper describes an architecture for virtual reality software which transparently supports a number of physical display systems and stereoscopic methods. Accurate, viewer-centered perspective projections are calculated, and graphics display options are set, automatically, independent of application code. The design is intended to allow greater portability of applications between different VR (and other) devices.
