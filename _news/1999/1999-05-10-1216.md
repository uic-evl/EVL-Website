In this paper we discuss the design and implementation of a plasma display panel for a wide field of view desktop virtual reality environment. Present commercial plasma displays are not designed with virtual reality in mind, leading to several problems in generating stereo imagery and obtaining good tracking information.  Although we developed solutions for a number of these problems, the limitations of the system preclude its current use in practical applications, and point to issues that must be resolved for flat panel displays to be useful for VR.
