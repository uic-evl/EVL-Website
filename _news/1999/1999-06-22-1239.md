The Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Indiana University collaborated on a major research demonstration at the IEEE / ACM Supercomputing &rsquo;98 (SC &rsquo;98) conference in Orlando, Florida, November 7-13, 1998 to showcase the evolution and importance of global research community networking. Collaborators worked together to solve complex computational problems using advance high-speed networks to access geographically distributed computing, storage and display resources. It is this collection of computer and communicaiton resources that we refer to as the International Grid (iGrid).
This paper presents an overview of the iGrid testbed, some of the underlying technologies used to enable distributed computing and collaborative problem solving, and descriptions of the applications. It concludes with recommendations for the future of global research community netowrking, based on the experiences of iGrid participants form the USA, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, The Netherlands, Russia, Switzerland, Singapore, and Taiwan.
