SAGE Display Controller, a web-based application designed and developed to access and control the SAGE environment. The application allows a novice user to interact with the environment from standard web browsers such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet explorer. The user interface represents the tiled display along with the application windows currently running on the SAGE environment. Interactivity is achieved by allowing multiple users to move and resize the application windows simultaneously.
