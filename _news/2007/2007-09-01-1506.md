<em>Object.</em> The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of ventriculostomy catheter placement on a head- and hand-tracked high-resolution and high-performance virtual reality and haptic technology workstation.<br><br>

<em>Methods.</em> Seventy-eight fellows and residents performed simulated ventriculostomy catheter placement on an ImmersiveTouch system. The virtual catheter was placed into a virtual patient&rsquo;s head derived from a computed tomography data set. Participants were allowed one attempt each. The distance from the tip of the catheter to the Monro foramen was measured.<br><br>

<em>Results.</em> The mean distance (6 standard deviation) from the final position of the catheter tip to the Monro foramen was 16.09 mm (6 7.85 mm).<br><br>

<em>Conclusions.</em> The accuracy of virtual ventriculostomy catheter placement achieved by participants using the simulator is comparable to the accuracy reported in a recent retrospective evaluation of free-hand ventriculostomy placements in which the mean distance from the catheter tip to the Monro foramen was 16 mm (6 9.6 mm).<br><br>
