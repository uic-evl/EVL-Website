Optically virtual concatenated parallel lambdas over multiple-domains that are provided using reservation-messaging between network resource managers for a high-end parallel visualizing application are experimentally shown for the first time in the Chicago metro area network.<br><br>

High-end visualizing applications are targeting parallelism using tiled displays and cluster computers to ensure unlimited scalability. Inevitably there will be a need for load-balanced parallel lambdas to carry their traffic. Then, these lambdas possibly traverse multiple network domains as needed. On the other hand, such applications are quite sensitive to latency deviations among these lambdas. There fore, we have proposed Optical Virtual Concatenation (OVC) to de-skew these lambdas. There have been no reports of the demonstration of load-balanced &amp; OVC-enabled parallel lambdas over multiple-domains.<br><br>

A network resource manager (NRM) with the capability to accept reservation requests of lambdas, to compute available routes, and to provide lambdas over a photonic network domain comprising Photonic Cross Connects (PXCs) in response to reservation requests form those applications will be a key device in the lambdaGrid network. It has the capability to dynamically configure parallel lambdas in collaboration with other network devices.<br><br>

In this paper, we present the first filed trial of the interworking of NRMs and OVC over two photonic netowrk domains against advanced reservation requests for netowrk resources form a visualization middleware, with is the Scalable Adaptive Graphic Environment (SAGE) developed by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL).
