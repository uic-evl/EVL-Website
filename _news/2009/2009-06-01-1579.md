Museums and researchers both have a need to display and interact with high-resolution data. There is great interest in using multi-touch tables, most of which are projector-based. However LCD-displays are becoming an attractive alternative to projectors because of their low cost of maintenance and image clarity. While touch screen overlays have been available for LCD panels for some time, these overlays were only able to register at most two touches. In contrast our project&rsquo;s goal was to create a touch table that is both LCD-based and can register an arbitrary number touches. This paper will provide the technical details of how to build such displays, one of which was HD (1080p) resolution while the other was 4- Megapixel resolution. This paper will also discuss how we plan to extend this technique to develop a multitouch autostereoscopic display.
