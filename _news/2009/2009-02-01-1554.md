This paper describes the design, development and user study of a text-to-speech system for reviewing email messages. The system retrieves messages, converts them to audio files, and facilitates transferring the messages to a portable listening device. This study reviews the efficacy of such a system and compares the users&rsquo; ability to comprehend spoken audio messages verses written messages. According to the study the system was successful, but the user interest in the design was only moderate.<br><br>
