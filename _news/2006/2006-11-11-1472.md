The Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment (SAGE) is specialized middleware for enabling data, high-definition video and extremely high-resolution graphics to be streamed in real-time from remotely distributed rendering and storage clusters to scalable display walls over ultrahigh-speed networks. In this paper, we present the SAGE architecture, focusing on its dynamic graphics streaming capability. In the SAGE framework, multiple visualization applications can be streamed to large tiled displays and viewed at the same time. The application windows can be moved, resized and overlapped like any standard desktop window manager. Every window movement or resize operation requires dynamic and non-trivial reconfiguration of the involved graphics streams. This approach has been successfully shown to scale to support streaming on the LambdaVision 100 Megapixel display wall. SAGE is now being extended to support distance collaboration with multiple endpoints by streaming visualization to all the participants.
