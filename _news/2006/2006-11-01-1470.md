Skin, the largest organ of the human body and the medium of physical contact that surrounds each and every one of us, has been a recurring subject in the research and artwork of this artist. Virtual Reality, because of its uniqueness as an experiential medium for the rendition of hybrid realities and dialogical situations between physical and digital existence, manifested as the experimental platform for the articulation and visualization of &ldquo;senses of touch&rdquo;.<br><br>

This work describes skin, 2006, a hyperstereoscopic high-definition interactive audiovisual installation that explores the intersection of the body as a landscape / mindscape and the body&rsquo;s own traces of touch.<br><br>
