LambdaGrid applications can generate hundreds to thousands of parallel flows. These flows emanate from network interfaces in the end-systems (i.e. the compute clusters) to communicate with other end-systems over multiple lightpaths. LambdaStream is an application-level UDP based transport protocol for LambdaGrids. We present wide-area results with LambdaStream over dedicated 10Gbps networks using the TeraGrid and CaveWave. We present results wherein we achieve close to 10Gbps unidirectional and over 18Gbps bidirectional over these high-speed wide-area networks.<br><br>
