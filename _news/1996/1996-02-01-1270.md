The Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) specializes in virtual reality (VR) and scientific visualization research. EVL is a major potential beneficiary of guaranteed latency and bandwidth promised by cell switch networking technology as the current shared Internet lines are inadequate for doing VR-to-VR, VR-to-supercomputer, and VR-to-supercomputer-to-VR research. EVL&rsquo;s computer scientists are working with their colleagues at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) to develop an infrastructure that enables computational scientists to apply VR, networking and scalable computing to problem solving. ATM and other optical networking schemes usher in a whole new era of sustainable high-speed networking capable of supporting telecollaboration among computational scientists and computer scientists in the immersive visual / multi-sensory domain.
