One of the current long term goals at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) is to create a persistent virtual environment enabling multiple transcontinentally-situated participants to apply collaborative Virtual Reality (VR) over high-speed and high-bandwidth networks connected to heterogeneous supercomputing resources and large data stores. Many of the applications in the GII Testbed at Supercomputing &rsquo;95 focused on connecting supercomputing resources to VR devices to visualize data from specific scientific problem domains[1]. Our focus, however, was on researching the techniques required to support general collaborative work in persistent virtual environments. These techniques include providing: representations for virtual co-presence; video and audio teleconferencing; virtual VR interfaces; and database technology for sustaining persistence in virtual worlds.<br><br>

These techniques have been showcased in a collaborative design laboratory called CALVIN in which participants at Supercomputing &rsquo;95 in San Diego and ARPA headquarters in Arlington, Virginia were able to join collectively in an interactive design session.
