Virtual reality (VR) shows great promise as a research tool in computational science and engineering. However, it involves new interface styles, different from those of traditional desktop interactive graphics. Because of this, a great deal of work can be required to develop VR applications, even when one is adapting existing desktop programs. For the use of VR to grow, it is important to provide the necessary software tools in addition to the basic hardware. An important focus of our Lab is to provide a programming environment which facilitates the development of practical VR applications.
