Driving safety is sensitive to conditions and diseases that affect sleep, and individuals with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome have a high risk of at-fault accidents. Most driving simulators used for research are unrealistic, stationary, prohibitively expensive, or not specifically designed to study sleep disorders. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a new lowcost, portable, realistic driving simulator intended for use in sleep disorders research.<br><br>
