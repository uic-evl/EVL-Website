Data management in scientific drilling programs such as the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP), and the Antarctic Drilling Program (ANDRILL) performs two functions: firstly, the capture of drilling and scientific data during an expedition, and secondly, the long-term storage and dissemination of these data. Here we describe the progress in linking data management with stand-alone data capture and visualization applications. This provides a two-way flow of data between the database and the applications, and a more integrated data environment for scientists. The new system has been tested, so far, with cores from the IODP Expedition 313 New Jersey Shallow Shelf and the ICDP Lake El&rsquo;gygytgyn Drilling Project.<br><br>

The image on the right shows the Corelyzer station at the IODP Exp. 313 New Jersey Shallow Shelf onshore science party at MARUM (University of Bremen). This station was fed continuously with scanned images and MSCL data of new core sections as they were added to the ExpeditionDIS. In conjunction with Correlator, this station was used for correlation between sites using lithological features and/or logging data.
