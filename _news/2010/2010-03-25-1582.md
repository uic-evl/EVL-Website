An algorithm to provide haptic feedback directly from volumetric datasets is introduced in this paper. The algorithm is able to reproduce and extend the functionality of surface-based haptics rendering methods. It can be easily implemented on top of existing haptic libraries, such as Sensable&rsquo;s OpenHaptics. In addition, our approach overcomes poor performance in OpenHaptics for models consisting of a large number of polygons (1Million+). The algorithm allows detecting collisions with multiple 3-dimensional shapes. After comparing alternative approaches, such as Depth Buffer and Feedback Buffer, as well as SenseGraphics&rsquo; Volume Haptics ToolKit (ScalarSurfaceFriction mode), our algorithm delivers the highest performance in terms of rendering time.
