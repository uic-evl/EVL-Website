## Virtual Sound Composition for the CAVE&reg;
**Bargar, R., Das, S.**
- Publication: Tokyo, Japan
The CAVE&reg; is a surround-screen projection-based virtual reality system developed at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory, University of Illinois at Chicago [Cruz-Neira, 1992]. Stereoscopic computer graphics are projected into a 10x10x10 foot cube made of display screens that surround the viewer, offering in its current implementation, images on three walls and the floor. One or more viewers explore the virtual world by moving around inside the cube. Unlike boom and headmounted displays the CAVE blends real and virtual objects in the same space: individuals can clearly see their bodies and their companions as they interact with virtual objects. Bringing sound into this environment can powerfully enhance the visual display, offering an experience of dimension and presence that screen images cannot provide. Due to an unique need for sound, virtual environments may provide an unprecendented platform for research and implementation of sound synthesis, localization and interactive control techniques. There are many expectations for what sound might provide, and few technical solutions. In the CAVE the role of auditory display draws upon criteria for composition as well as criteria for reproducing naturalistic sound [Bargar, 1993].
