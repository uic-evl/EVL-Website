CAVE&reg; Virtual Reality System

The Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago has developed a new virtual reality interface called the CAVE&trade; (CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment).<br><br>

It surrounds the viewer with projected images of a virtual environment. Three rear-projection screens make up three walls of a ten-foot cube that all but disappear when illuminated with computer graphics. A fourth data projector illuminates the floor for complete immersion. The viewer can move around the virtual environment and see his own body as he interacts with real and virtual objects.<br><br>

This paper describes the use of a projection-based virtual reality (VR) interface (the CAVE&trade;) for persons with disability. It compares the projection paradigm with the more common VR technologies of head or boom-mounted displays and their associated position sensing techniques. In particular, advantages and disadvantages of the CAVE&trade; are discussed in terms of disability issues.<br><br>

These include shared or guided experiences, physical access to the technology, intrusiveness on the user and inclusion of real world objects in the environment.<br><br>

Finally, appropriate disability related applications for projection based virtual environments are considered in light of the inherent properties.
