A time diagram of CQSim+ performing meta-scheduling for multiple systems.

Efficient job scheduling is crucial in high-performance computing (HPC), balancing user demands for quick job turnaround with facility goals for high resource utilization. Traditional scheduling requires users to specify a system at job submission, which can lead to inefficiencies. A unified scheduling approach, viewing the resources within a computing facility as an integrated pool, promises improved resource use and reduced job wait times. This paper presents CQSim+, an open-source, discrete event-driven simulator tailored for symbiotic multi-resource scheduling. CQSim+ supports dynamic simulation by continuously integrating real-time data from job schedulers, enabling adaptive scheduling based on the system&rsquo;s current state. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate CQSim+&rsquo;s ability to enhance resource utilization and decrease job wait times in both homogeneous and heterogeneous HPC environments.<br><br>
Additionally, we present a case study that coordinates job scheduling between two production systems, illustrating how CQSim+ can effectively optimize job scheduling across distinct systems.<br><br>
