HEP workflows often consist of complex DAGs with streaming job arrivals that challenge traditional static scheduling approaches. We introduce a dynamic pilot job scheduling model that allocates HPC resources on demand when queued DAG jobs reach a configurable threshold. The simulation framework models interactions between the trace parser, DAG manager, pilot job manager, and HPC resources. The system improves scheduling responsiveness and resource utilization by reserving nodes as needed and scheduling jobs in batches based on DAG dependencies.
