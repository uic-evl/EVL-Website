High-performance computing (HPC) job scheduling has seen promising advances with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). However, challenges such as low interpretability, instability, and high computational cost hinder DRL&rsquo;s practical adoption. We explore a model-based alternative using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to overcome these limitations. By leveraging existing HPC simulators as models for MCTS and focusing on transparent decision-making, we aim to develop a scalable and interpretable scheduling solution fit for real-world deployment.
