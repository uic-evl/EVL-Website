<strong>Motivation:</strong><br>
•	Parallel Discrete Event Simulations (PDES) offers accurate HPC simulations but is computationally intensive and slow to scale.<br>
•	Surrogate models can accelerate simulations, and we explore if causal insights can improve their long-term forecasting stability.<br><br>
<strong>Research Questions:</strong><br>
•	Can Causal Signals hidden in HPC simulations unlock better forecasting?<br>
•	Can different Causal Discovery methods identify key drivers for accurate surrogate forecasting?<br>
