Dream Grrrls is a virtual reality world created for the CAVE. The design focuses on, but is not limited to, Gigliotti&rsquo;s criteria for virtual aesthetics: content, interface, environment, perception, performance and plasticity. Similar to the dream-state, Dream Grrrls is a journey through five worlds that present an opportunity for exploration and self-reflection. The following pages illustrate the criteria individually, but each world in Dream Grrrls illustrates them collectively as well.
