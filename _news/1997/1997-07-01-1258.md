The Pythagorean theorem states that for any right triangle the area of the smallest square (AxA) plus (+) the area of the middle sized square (BxB) will always equal (=) the area of the largest square (CxC). Thus (A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup> = C<sup>2</sup>).<br><br>

But this simple algebraic formula, while truthful, reveals nothing of the elegant visual constructions devised for its demonstration.
