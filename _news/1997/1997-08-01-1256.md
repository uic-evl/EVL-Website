The VideoAvatar Library is a collection of functions that works in conjunction with the Cave&trade; Library, and can be used to add static, photo-realistic three-dimensional representations of remote users, as well as other objects or agents, to virtual reality applications. The process involves obtaining views from 360 degrees around the person to be represented, then selecting two of these images, one for each eye, to represent the user in 3D space.
