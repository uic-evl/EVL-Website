My first experience with the web started as a Research Assistant for the webgroup at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL). While studying virtual reality and computer graphics, web technologies were introduced. As time progressed, I realized that my interest was leading me to build art projects on the web.<br><br>

The concept of emergent behavior was then introduced which led to ideas of using a social system to fuel visualizations over the internet. The goal was to make a visualization that was organic and behaved as if it had a life of its own, but it was also important to engage the audience. Adopting the notion of the man behind the machine transferred the use of emergent behavior to using human interaction to compose the art.
