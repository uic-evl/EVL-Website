In electronically mediated distance collaborations involving scientific data, there is often the need to stream the graphical output of individual computers or entire visualization clusters to remote displays.<br><br>

This paper presents TeraVision as a scalable platform-independent solution which is capable of transmitting multiple synchronized high-resolution video streams between single workstations and/or clusters without requiring any modifications to be made to the source or destination machines.<br><br>

Issues addressed include: how to synchronize individual video streams to form a single larger stream; how to scale and route streams generated by an array of MxN nodes to fit a XxY display; and how TeraVision exploits a variety of transport protocols.<br><br>

Results from experiments conducted over gigabit local-area networks and wide-area networks (between Chicago and Amsterdam), are presented. Finally, we propose the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment (SAGE) - an architecture to support future collaborative visualization environments with potentially billions of pixels.
