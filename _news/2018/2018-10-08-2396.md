Pollution exposure assessment at the population level is an established enterprise for environmental scientists and public health officials - but efforts to help individuals monitor and track their personal pollution exposures have just begun to garner research interest. Self-tracking pollution exposure is challenging for several reasons, including current limitations in sensor size, accuracy, and cost, frequent calibration requirements, and that people&rsquo;s daily activities often interfere with data quality in wearable sensing. The goal of this research is to develop a human-centered computing framework for the emerging field of personal pollution exposure assessment. To that aim, in this position paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to combine environmental sensing data from different spatiotemporal resolutions, such as from citywide national monitoring stations, neighborhood-wide lightweight sensing nodes, and personal wearables.<br><br>
