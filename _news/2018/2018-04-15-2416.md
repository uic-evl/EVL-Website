In  this  paper,  we  present  one  saliency-based  feature  selection  and  tracking  strategy  in  the  feature-based  stereoscopic panoramic  video  generation  system.   Many  existing  stereoscopic video composition approaches aim at producing high-quality  panoramas  from  multiple  input  cameras;  however, most  of  them  directly  operate  image  alignment  on  those originally detected features without any refinement or optimization.   The  standard  global  feature  extraction  threshold always fails to guarantee stitching correctness of all human interested regions.   Thus,  based on the originally commonly  identified  feature  set, we incorporate  the  saliency  map into  the  distribution  of  control  points  to  remove  the  redundancy  in  texture-rich  regions  and  ensure  the  adequacy  of selected features in visual sensitive regions.  Intuitively, under the guidance of saliency change in the video sequence, one grid-based feature updating strategy is operated between consecutive frames instead of the standard global feature updating.  The experiments show that our method can improve the stitching quality of visual important region without impairment to the human less-interested regions in the generated stereoscopic panoramic video.<br><br>
