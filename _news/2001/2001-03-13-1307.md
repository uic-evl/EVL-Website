This paper presents our findings after the first year and a half of a multi-year deployment of an ImmersaDesk to a local elementary school, investigating its effectiveness in enhancing science education. These findings deal with how VR can aid in the coordination of multiple representations, and how to integrate the technology into the existing school culture.
