Liquidon is an immersive, realtime, audio-visual composition that consists of a virtual environment and an interactive multi-channel soundscape. Liquidon explores the field of ITC. ITC, an acronym for Instrumental Transcommunication, is a field of research pertaining to the use of technological apparatus to facilitate communication with the dead. Liquidon utilizes a custom camera-based interface to capture video from a randomly tuned analog television set. The video frames are analyzed by the system and used to construct a three-dimensional representation of the image. Parametric data is extracted from the video frames and shared via a local area network with the sound composition. The composition is generated by a set of interconnected synthesis and processing modules developed in Max / MSP. Fragments of ITC recordings made by researchers such as Konstantin Raudive, Friedrich Jurgenson, and Raymond Cass are processed by the system, interwoven with a live radiophonic input, and dynamically distributed across multiple loudspeakers. Parameters such as pitch, amplitude, and phase are periodically tracked and shared via the network with the virtual environment. These parameters are used to influence the rendering and spatial distribution of the geometry. This, the two systems, visual and acoustic, remain locked in an evolving relationship of interdependence. This gives rise to a non-deterministic composition that is structured by feedback.
