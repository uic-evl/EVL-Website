<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
<strong>Purpose:</strong> Using a 200 Head and Neck cancer (HNC) patient cohort, we employ patient similarity based on tumor location, volume, and proximity to organs at risk to predict radiation-associated dysphagia (RAD) in a new patient receiving intensity-modulated
radiation therapy (IMRT).<br><br>
<strong>Material and Methods:</strong> All patients were treated using curative-intent IMRT. Anatomical features were extracted from contrast-enhanced tomography scans acquired pre-treatment. Patient similarity was computed using a topological similarity measure, which allowed for the prediction of normal tissuesâ€™ mean doses. We performed feature selection and clustering, and used the resulting groups of patients to forecast RAD. We used Logistic Regression (LG) cross-validation to assess the potential toxicity risk of these groupings.<br><br>
<strong>Results:</strong> Out of 200 patients, 34 patients were recorded as having RAD. Patient clusters were significantly correlated with RAD (p < .0001). The area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) using pre-established, baseline features gave a predictive accuracy of .79, while the addition of our cluster labels improved accuracy to .84.<br><br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> Our results show that spatial information available pre-treatment can be used to robustly identify groups of RAD high-risk patients. We identify feature sets that considerably improve toxicity risk prediction beyond what is possible using baseline features. Our results also suggest that similarity-based predicted mean doses to organs can be used as valid predictors of risk to organs.<br><br>
