<strong>COMPaaS DLV</strong>, COMposable Platform as a Service Instrument for Deep Learning & Visualization, was purchased from Liqid, Inc., with NSF funds.  Its 4th-generation computer architecture, composable infrastructure, treats computer components - computer processing units (CPUs), graphical processing units (GPUs), networking, memory and storage - as pools of resources.  It is:<br><br>
<ul><li><strong>Highly flexible.</strong>  Each application defines the resources it needs, and the operating system composes, or combines, resources on the fly.</li><br>
<li><strong>Scalable. </strong>  As more infrastructure is added, itâ€™s auto-integrated with the existing infrastructure and becomes part of the pool of capacity.</li><br>
<li><strong>High-throughput.</strong>  System components are interconnected with a high-speed internal fabric, enabling Big Data to quickly move among CPU, GPU, memory and storage at optimum speeds with little to no bottlenecks.</ul></li><br>
Funded in part by NSF award #CNS-1828265.
