Interface development process.

The data entry task is one of the common office tasks performed in the seated position that can be assisted by augmented reality technology. The paper introduces an ongoing project to develop an AR-based data presentation interface to assist office workers&rsquo; data entry tasks. The interface developed in this project was designed to facilitate the transition between the two steps including reading data and typing the data into a computer system using a keyboard. Usability evaluation is conducted in a controlled experiment with human subjects to examine whether the AR-based data presentation interface improves data entry performance and mitigates office workers&rsquo; physical and mental workload.<br><br>
