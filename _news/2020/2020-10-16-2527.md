Two users interact with the 3D interface

We developed a collaborative virtual environment for architectural planning that facilitates groups of people to work together using three different interfaces. These interfaces enable users to interact with the scene with varying levels of immersion and different interaction modalities. We conducted a user study to gauge the general usability of the system and to understand how the different interfaces affect the group work. In this paper we present the architecture of the system along with its different interfaces. We also present the user study results and the insights we gained from the study.<br><br>
