SAGE2 is a user-centered platform for small groups or large distributed teams to access digital media datasets from various sources and juxtapose, share and investigate content on tiled display walls. SAGE2 builds on SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment), developed with prior NSF funding. SAGE2 is having a transformative effect on data exploration, visualization and collaboration, making cyberinfrastructure more accessible to end-users, both in the laboratory and in the classroom.<br><br>
