Imaging is an integral tool in radiation oncology, starting from initial diagnosis to follow-up post-therapy. In head and neck
cancer treatment, toxicity and tumor control depend on the tumor locational geometry and systematic predictable spread of disease to
affected lymph nodes (LN) levels. However, a rigorous methodology for integrating imaging spatial information into treatment outcome
prediction models remains an unmet need. We hypothesized that integrating tumor and LN spatial information derived from routine diagnostic images can aid in prediction model development for both oncologic outcomes and post-therapy toxicity.<br><br>
