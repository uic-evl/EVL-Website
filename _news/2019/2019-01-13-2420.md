An EPIModule: camera head PCB at left, processor PCB at right.

We discuss the design and operation of an Epipolar-Plane Imaging light-field camera array and embedded-computation system designed for panoramic operation. Built from a planar configured EPI module, this is a hybrid capable of imaging in 360ยบ x 3D. We discuss the geometry and constraints of EPI imaging, its connection with the design and structuring of the acquisition array, and the architecture of the EPIModule forming the basis for our panoramic capture. Finally, we show an arrangement of modules on a geodesic - the Truncated Icosahedron of football/soccer - which happens to suit the optical and mechanical properties of the first EPIModule we have built. Results are preliminary; more will be presented for the conference publication.
