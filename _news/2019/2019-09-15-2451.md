When speaking to second language learners, talkers often reduce their rate of speech to assist their listeners&rsquo; understanding and comprehension. This study grants English as a Second Language subjects fine-grained, real-time control over the playback rates of lengthy audio tracks of conversational speech, and tests the subjects&rsquo; listening comprehension at their desired playback speeds and at unmodified speeds. We find evidence that slower playback rates are preferred, but no evidence that such playback rates affect listener comprehension.<br><br>
