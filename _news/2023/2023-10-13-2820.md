Estimating the human posture from an image or a video is a fundamental task in computer vision. It not only enhances other vision tasks like action recognition, person re-identification, and virtual try-on but also facilitates many real-world applications including robotics, healthcare, sports, and retail. An effective and efficient human pose estimation system can enable robots to acquire skills from demonstrations, support physical therapists in diagnosing and rehabilitating patients, assist sports analysts and coaches in tracking and training athletes, and empower retailers to establish employee-free stores. Thanks to the advancement of deep learning and the availability of large-scale datasets, the performance of state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods has drastically improved in recent years. These approaches can accurately estimate postures in daily activities and sports. However, several challenges persist. For example, (1) it remains challenging to estimate postures that occur rarely or are entirely absent in the training data; (2) handling complex scenarios, such as crowded environments, motion blur, low-light conditions, and occlusions, is still a formidable task; (3) there is a growing need to develop efficient models that can estimate human poses in real-time or on low-power devices; (4) exploring novel applications for human pose estimation that can bring societal benefits or transform industries is an exciting avenue of research. This special issue presents a collection of high-quality papers on human pose estimation and its applications. They cover a wide range of topics, from fundamental human pose models with improved accuracy and efficiency to applications in human behavior understanding and assessment, sign language recognition, and multi-camera calibration. Through this special issue, we would like to open the path toward more discussion between practitioners and researchers in this very important yet challenging field of human pose estimation.
