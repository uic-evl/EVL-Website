PSA is an immersive MR/VR framework for experiencing and analyzing recorded conversations and events. We see two participants represented as virtual avatars engaged in a conversation.

Using immersive environments for training, education, and recreation is becoming increasingly popular among individuals. In recent years these environments have also been used to facilitate data analytics processes involving interaction and task completion. In this work, we discuss Personal Situated Analytics (PSA) a cross-platform framework to embed users into recorded conversations with support for multiple degrees of immersion in the Reality-Virtuality spectrum. Our development pipeline consisted of several stages: tracking, data capturing, data cleaning, data synchronization, prototype building, and deploying the final product to end-user hardware. We evaluate PSA by analyzing data from a recorded meeting involving human participants and a visual conversational AI agent. Our pilot study (n = 12) using this framework compares user experiences for MR and VR environments.<br><br>
