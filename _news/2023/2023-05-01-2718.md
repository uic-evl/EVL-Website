This figure shows the respective volumetric/spheric plots for 07/02/2021 at 1000 hPa. Figure 2:

Methane the main component of natural gas is also a potent greenhouse gas that requires robust monitoring, so that scientists, educators, and the general public can get better informed of its effect(s) on local/regional air quality and current short-term mitigations for climate change. However, current data visualizations for methane, and other scientific data, are either static 2-D graphs/plots or animated through using videos/gifs. These data visualization approaches can be limiting in that they lack interactiveness for an end user to gain exploratory insights by comparing and contrasting different areas of a dataset. This report thereby showcases how to build a functional and interactive visualization as the solution to the previously mentioned limitation.<br><br>
