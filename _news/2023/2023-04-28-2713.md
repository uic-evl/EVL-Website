Fig 1. On the left is the CAVE2 version of the application. Fig 2. On the right is the desktop version of the application.

Background:  Existing studies have reported that forest therapy utilizing sensory stimuli increases the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system and decreases the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.<br><br>
Purpose:  To observe the effects of guided scenic meditation in a virtual reality environment on physiological stress.<br><br>
To perform a platform comparison by deploying the same meditative experience and testing its effectiveness using a room-scale display and a desktop computer.<br><br>
Significance:  Rather than using a headset, the study uses a room-scale display - the CAVE2 Hybrid-Reality Environment - to test the effects of virtual reality environments on stress reduction.<br><br>
The platform comparison intends to showcase that if proven effective, the product is accessible, as desktop computers are far more affordable ($400 - $1000) and widely available relative to room-scale displays ($1 million+).
