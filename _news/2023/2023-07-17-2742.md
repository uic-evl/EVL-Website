Search interface displaying the results of a boolean query.

<strong>Motivation:</strong> Figures in biomedical papers communicate essential information with the potential to identify relevant documents in biomedical and clinical settings. However, academic search interfaces mainly search over text fields.<br><br>
<strong>Results:</strong> We describe a search system for biomedical documents that leverages image modalities and an existing index server. We integrate a problem-specific taxonomy of image modalities and image-based data into a custom search system. Our solution features a front-end interface to enhance classical document search results with image-related data, including page thumbnails, figures, captions, and image-modality information. We demonstrate the system on a subset of the CORD-19 document collection. A quantitative evaluation demonstrates higher precision and recall for biomedical document retrieval. A qualitative evaluation with domain experts further highlights our solutionâ€™s benefits to biomedical search.<br><br>
<strong>Availability and implementation:</strong> A demonstration is available at <a href="https://runachay.evl.uic.edu/scholar">https://runachay.evl.uic.edu/scholar</a>. Our code and image models can be accessed via <a href="https://github.com/uic-evl/bio-search">https://github.com/uic-evl/bio-search</a>. The dataset is continuously expanded.<br><br>
<strong>Image caption:</strong> Search interface displaying the results of a boolean query. (A) The color-coded legend displays the image modalities in the first level of the taxonomy. (B) The search bar, with a keyword box showing a boolean query, a time filter, and an image modalities filter limiting results to documents containing \textit{radiology} or \textit{fluorescence microscopy} figures. (C) The metadata of a result includes the document title, year, venue, authors, and the hits on the abstract and full text. Below is the count of figures and modalities in the document. (D) The enhanced document surrogate shows the image content, including the page thumbnail, extracted figure, subfigures and modalities, and caption.<br><br>
