We describe a novel art-empowered Virtual Reality (VR) system designed for hand rehabilitation therapy following stroke. The system was developed by an interdisciplinary team of engineers, art therapists, occupational therapists, and VR artist to improve patient&rsquo;s motivation and engagement. We describe system design, development, and user testing for efficiency, subject&rsquo;s satisfaction and clinical feasibility. We report initial results following use of the system on the first four subjects from the ongoing clinical efficacy trials as measured by standard clinical tests for upper extremity function. These cases demonstrate that the system is operational and can facilitate therapy for post stroke patients with upper extremity impairment.<br><br>
