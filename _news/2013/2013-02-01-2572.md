User Interface of an example decision-making assistant based on knowledge discovery using data mining of Nursing Care Plans

Pain management of end of life patients (EOL) (n=596 episodes) is examined using statistical and data mining processes of the HANDS database of care plans coded with NANDA-I, NOC, and NIC (NNN) terminologies. HANDS episode data (episode =care plans updated at every handoff on a patient while staying on a hospital unit) were gathered in 8 units located in 4 different health care facilities (total episodes = 40,747; EOL episodes = 1,425) over two years. Results show the multiple discoveries such as EOL patients with hospital stays (< 72 hrs.) are less likely (p<0.005) to meet the pain relief goals compared to EOL patients with longer hospital stays. The study demonstrates a major benefit of systematically integrating NNN into electronic health records.<br><b>
