SAGE, the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment, receives major funding from the National Science Foundation to provide the scientific community with persistent visualization and collaboration services for global cyberinfrastructure. SAGE is a widely used open-source platform and the defacto operating system, or framework, for managing &ldquo;big data&rdquo; content on scalable-resolution tiled display walls. This is the fifth BOF that the SAGE development team has held at SC. SC provides an unparalleled opportunity for the global SAGE user community and potential users to meet, review current development efforts, share community-developed use cases, and have discussions on user requirements and future roadmaps.
