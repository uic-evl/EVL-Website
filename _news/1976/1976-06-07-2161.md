## The digital component of the circle graphics habitat

This real-time interactive computer graphics system derives from the author&rsquo;s dissertation at the Ohio State University (National Science Foundation Grant GJ-204, Charles A. Csuri, project director).  The system, called &ldquo;The Graphics Symbiosis System&rdquo; or &ldquo;Grass&rdquo; was first designed to help artists interactively explore computer art without the constant companionship of a programmer.  Over the past three years, it has been expanded at the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle and is now the image generation portion of a short-order full-color animation videotape production facility called &ldquo;The Circle Graphics Habitat.&rdquo;  Combined with Dan Sandin&rsquo;s Image Processor, the system is sufficiently powerful and flexible to be used in real-time performance context here at UICC.
