Hearts and Minds as presented in the CAVE2 in the Electronic Visualization Lab at the University of Illinois Chicago.

&ldquo;Hearts and Minds: The Interrogations Project&rdquo; is an interactive virtual reality narrative performance made for the EVL&rsquo;s CAVE2&trade; large-scale 320-degree panoramic virtual reality environment that visualizes stories of violence and the post-traumatic stress experienced by ordinary American soldiers who became torturers in the course of serving their country. During the American-led counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism campaigns in Iraq in the years after 11 September 2001, the torture and abuse of detainees was a commonplace tactic.
