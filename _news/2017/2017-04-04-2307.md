We propose a &ldquo;Scalable Amplified Group Environment&rdquo; to enable large-scale human and data interaction and collaboration on High-Resolution Display Walls. To enable effective critical thinking and brainstorming sessions within the room and between distributed sites, we need new technologies that can be described as &ldquo;Collaboration as a Service&rdquo; (CaaS).<br>
CaaS features include:<br>
- On demand collaboration with dynamic resource allocation to support collaborative visualization sessions first within the room and then between several sites,<br>
- Enabling online large scale data analysis and visual analytics,<br>
- Support for many visualization types: local rendering (web-based) and hardware remote rendering transmitted as high-quality video streams (GPU-rendering and video compression in the cloud).
