<strong>SAGE2</strong> is a user-centered platform for small groups or large distributed teams to access large-scale datasets from various sources and juxtapose, share and investigate content on tiled display walls. SAGE2 builds on SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment), developed with NSF prior funding. With 69 sites worldwide since 2015, SAGE2 is having a transformative effect on data exploration, visualization and collaboration, making cyberinfrastructure more accessible to end users both in the laboratory and in the classroom.<br><br>
