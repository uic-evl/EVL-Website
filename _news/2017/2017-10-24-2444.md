Illustration of user viewing an embodiment of a patterned-retarded barrier layer shifted adjacent to a layer of pixels from a side view.

A system and methods for visualizing information on a generally large scale. Certain embodiments include display elements that include a minimized border margin, 2D/3D dual functionality, and ultra-high resolution. The display elements may be positioned relative to an infrastructure element configured to permit generating a wide variety of display geometries.<br><br>
This patent resulted in realizing the CAVE2 Hybrid Reality Environment.
