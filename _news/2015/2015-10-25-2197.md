This paper introduces a novel web application that visualizes dark matter halo merger trees and their evolution through space and
time. Our application enables users to interact with individual halos within these trees in order to perform a range of visual analysis
tasks, including: identifying the substructure and superstructure of the halos; observing the movement of halos across a specified range of time steps; and comparing the branching characteristics of multiple trees. Central to our application is the ability to navigate the halos by interactively &ldquo:jumping&rdquo; from tree to tree. By clearly marking halos that have &ldquo;tributaries&rdquo; - that is, halos that split off into multiple halos or that merge with one or more halos - we make it easy for the user to traverse the complex structure of the universe. Our application is publicly available online and runs at interactive rates on the browser.
