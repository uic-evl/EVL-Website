Achievable networking performance of applications in a supercomputer depends on the exact combination of the communication patterns of the applications and the routing algorithms used by the supercomputer. In order to achieve the highest networking performance for the applications the routing algorithms need to be designed optimally for those communication patterns. However, while communication patterns usually have a wide variation from application to application and even from phase to phase in an application, routing algorithms have a limited variation and usually are optimized for typical communication patterns. This results in high networking performance for favored communication patterns but low networking performance for others. In this paper we present approaches for improving networking performance by rebalancing load on physical links on the Blue Gene Q supercomputer. We realize our approaches in a framework called OPTIQ and demonstrate the efficacy of our framework via a set of benchmarks. Our results show that we can achieve 30% higher throughput on experiment with data and patterns from a real application. The improvement can be up to several times higher throughput than default MPI_Alltoallv used in the Blue Gene Q supercomputer for certain communication patterns.<br><br>
