Collaborative visual analytics that feature mixtures of spatial and nonspatial data occur across disciplines, and are particularly common in bioinformatics, neuroscience and geospatial analysis. In this work we analyze, from a human-centric perspective, data collected from the design and evaluation of three successful visual analysis tools, spanning seven case studies. We focus on the importance of the users&rsquo; background to the design process, and we discuss the importance of visual scaffolding to such collaborative, integrated spatial and nonspatial visual analysis tools. Scaffolding is a psychology concept which denotes the support given during a learning process. We further present evidence that spatial and nonspatial coordinated views can serve as a form of visual scaffolding for expert-level, collaborative visual analyses.<br><br>
