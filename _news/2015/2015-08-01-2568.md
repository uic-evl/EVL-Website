Numeracy and Graph Literacy Means and Standard Deviations by Nurse Characteristics

We present findings of a comparative study of numeracy and graph literacy in a representative group of 60 practicing nurses. The paper focuses on a fundamental concern related to the effectiveness of numeric information displayed in various features in the electronic health record during clinical workflow. Our findings suggest the need to consider numeracy and graph literacy when presenting numerical information as well as the potential for tailoring numeric display types to individual&rsquo;s cognitive strengths.<br><br>
