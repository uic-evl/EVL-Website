A natural language interface to visual data exploration would allow a user to directly specify questions through speech, allowing the user to focus on higher-order tasks, such as hypothesis generation and question formulation.<br><br>
However, visual data exploration involves repeated cycles of visualization construction and interaction, as well as reasoning across many visualizations generated over the course of an exploratory session. A &rsquo;conversational interface&rsquo;, which maintains a dialog with the user through natural language and gestures, could support these complex tasks.<br><br>
We conducted an observational, exploratory study to observe the interaction between a subject and a remote data analysis expert (DAE) who assists the subject in an exploratory data analysis task.
