In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a Virtual Reality (VR) art piece - &ldquo;Kites flying in and out of space&rdquo; that was inspired by the kite-like art forms of French artist, Jackie Matisse. We use a physically based animation method known as the mass-spring model to realistically simulate the movement of these virtual kitetail forms in the CAVE VR theatre. In this immersive environment, the user can interact with these &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; kites by moving them, changing their imagery or adding a wind force. However, the real-time requirements imposed by immersive environments and the computational complexity in calculating these forms inhibit the number of kites we can &ldquo;fly&rdquo;. To address this limitation, we show how the use of distributed computing resources across the GRID can provide a scalable solution. Serendipitously, we also discovered that the movement of these virtual art forms became visual metaphors for the network performance and parameters.<br><br>
