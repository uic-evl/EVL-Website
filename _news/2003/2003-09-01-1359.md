The field is a simulated virtual enviroment designed to help elementary school students learn the basic skills of observational science in the context of mathematics and science.<br><br>

Over the last four years, we have iteratively developed technical aids for navigation and data collection based on observations we have conducted in an elementary school.<br><br>

This paper discusses the problems students encountered in the Field, the augmenting tools developed to address the issues, and theirs impacts to students&rsquo; behavior.
