A tale of two head and neck cancer centers, University of Illinois and MD Anderson Cancer Center.

The annual incidence of head and neck cancers (HNC) worldwide is more than 550,000 cases, with around 300,000 deaths each year. However, the incidence rates and disease-characteristics of HNC differ between treatment centers and different populations, due to undetermined reasons, which may or not include socioeconomic factors. The multi-faceted and multi-variate nature of the data in the context of the emerging field of health disparities research makes automated analysis impractical. Hence, we present a visual analysis approach to explore the health disparities in the data of HNC patients from two different cohorts at two cancer care centers. Our approach integrates data from multiple sources, including census data and city data, with custom visual encodings and with a nearest
neighbor approach. Our design, created in collaboration with oncology experts, makes it possible to analyze the patientsâ€™ demographic, disease characteristics, treatments and outcomes, and to make significant comparisons of these two cohorts and of individual patients. We evaluate this approach through two case studies performed with domain experts. The results demonstrate that this visual analysis approach successfully accomplishes the goal of comparing two cohorts in terms of different significant factors, and can provide insights into the main source of health disparities between the two centers.<br><br>
