Inaccessible urban infrastructure creates and reinforces systemic exclusion of people with disabilities and impacts public health, physical activity, and quality of life for all. To improve the design of our cities and to enable more equitable policies and location-centric
technology designs, we need new data collection techniques, data standards, and accessibility-infused analytic tools and interactive maps focused on the quality, safety, and accessibility of pathways, transit ecosystems, and buildings. In this workshop, we bring together leading experts in human mobility, urban design, disability, and accessible computing to discuss pressing urban access challenges across the world and brainstorm solutions. We invite contributions from practitioners, transit officials, disability advocates,
and researchers.
