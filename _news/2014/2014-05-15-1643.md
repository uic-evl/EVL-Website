As scalable resolution display walls are becoming a common tool for visualizing and analyzing large amounts of data, many interaction techniques have been developed to explore information displayed on the wall. While the use of multi-touch has found widespread use in personal devices, limited work has been done exploring multi-touch interaction on scalable resolution display walls where multiple users can be simultaneously interacting with the display either collaboratively or independently. This thesis presents a multi-user interface designed to explore the potential of multi-touch on large scalable resolution display walls. This system allows multiple users to have access to the user interface anywhere across the display and search through collections of media files in a personal space. Finally this thesis will examine different layouts of the user interface and present the results of a user experience study to evaluate this multi-touch centric user interface design.
