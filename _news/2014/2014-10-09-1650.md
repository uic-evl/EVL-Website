The CAVE2 is a large-scale, 320-degree, 3D / 2D, virtual-reality environment developed by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The environment has a tracking system that determines the location of the primary user, and then renders 3D images to his perspective. The CAVE2 also has a 20.2 channel sound system controlled by a SuperCollider-based audio server that is, in turn, controlled via the Omicron SoundAPI. Audio imaging for the system had operated with the assumption that the listener was stationary in the center of the CAVE2 and the individual source width of audio objects was not dynamically altered. Our team added functionality to maintain audio imaging, including source position and width, as a tracked user and sound object move relative to one another within the environment.
