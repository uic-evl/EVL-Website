In this paper, we propose an approach to improving the I/O performance of an IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputing system using a novel framework that can be integrated into high performance applications. We take advantage of the systems&rsquo; tremendous computing resources and high interconnection bandwidth among compute nodes to efficiently exploit I/O bandwidth. This approach focuses on loss-less data compression, topology-aware data movement, and subfiling. The efficacy of this solution is demonstrated using micro-benchmarks and an application-level benchmark.
