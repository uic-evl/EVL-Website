Hearts and Minds: The Interrogations Project is an interactive Virtual Reality narrative performance made for the EVL&rsquo;s CAVE2&trade; large-scale 320-degree panoramic virtual reality environment that visualizes stories of violence and the post-traumatic stress experienced by ordinary American soldiers who became torturers in the course of serving their country.
