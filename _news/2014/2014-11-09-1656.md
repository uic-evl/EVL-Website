Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems have the potential of significantly improving the quality and efficiency of patient care, but they need to present information in a way that is easily understandable by health care personnel. In the clinical setting, nurses are often tasked with the care of a large number of patients, and in specific scenarios are in charge of independently making care decisions to improve patient comfort and for symptom relief care. We developed a CDS prototype embedded in a nursing hand-off management tool, which provides suggestions to adjust a plan of care based on a patient&rsquo;s profile. We show how presenting patient data and evidence in different forms (textual, tabular, graphical) has an impact on the efficiency of nurse decision making, and how a nurse&rsquo;s graphical literacy influences this process.<br><br>
