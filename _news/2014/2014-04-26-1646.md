We present our experience ind esigning and testing a CDSS interface embedded in a nursing Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) system. Our interface directed professional nurse clinicians towards an optimal care decision that was rarely performed in non-CDSS-assisted practice. We also show how decision making isa ffected by CDSS feature grouping and by the navigation strategy of nurses within the interface. These findings provide insights into effective nursing CDSS design that are generalizable to care scenarios different than end-of-life.
