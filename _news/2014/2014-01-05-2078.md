This paper proposes a method that creates a multi-view interactive visualization that allows users to explore connections between garbage collection (GC) generated by Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and latency in applications used in financial transactions. With this tool users can explore large collections of GC and latency events, easily identify important events, and subsequently focus on the relationships and details of such events without losing the “big picture” perspective on the events as a whole. We discuss the impact of this tool on controlling the effects of GC on latency and variability in financial trades with an exchange.<br><br>
