Five public artworks are presented that feature data visualization situated in site-specific installations, each with distinct conditions of data collection, data analysis, audience interaction, and data archiving. This paper describes unique features of these projects and notes solutions to issues related especially to the staging of visual representation. Based on an examination of these issues, observed in different settings throughout the last decade, the paper concludes with an overview of key considerations specific to presenting data visualization in site-specific locations.
