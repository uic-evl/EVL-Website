We introduce a web-based, client-server computing infrastructure to assist the interactive navigation of large-scale astronomy observations. Large image datasets are partitioned into a spatial index structure that allows prefix-matching of spatial objects. In conjunction with pixel-based overlays, this approach allows fetching, displaying, panning and zooming of gigabit panoramas of the sky in real time. Images from three sky surveys (SDSS, FIRST and simulated LSST results) are cross-registered and integrated as overlays, allowing cross-spectrum analysis of astronomy observations. The front-end of the infrastructure uses the web technologies WebGL and HTML5 to enable cross-platform, web-based functionality. Our approach attains interactive rendering framerates; its power and flexibility enables us to serve the needs of the astronomy community. Evaluation on a galaxy case study, as well as feedback from domain experts emphasize the benefits of this visual approach to the observational astronomy field.<br><br>
