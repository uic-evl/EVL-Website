In the CineGrid Exchange project, we use iRODS to curate and preserve super-high-definition media content such as 4K movies. Our media curation platform enables long-term data preservation and streamlined workflows for curators to handle large amount of media data in a cross-organizational environment. The platform consists of a front-end web catalog system and a back-end storage and workflow system.<br><br>

The front-end is a web-based content management system and brings ease-of-use in metadata management and data retrieval. The back-end is an iRODS-based distributed storage system that guarantees data consistency and redundancy. It also provides an event-based rule engine to realize flexible workflows.
