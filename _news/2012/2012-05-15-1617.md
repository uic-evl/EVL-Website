This work presents a novel immersive workstation environment that scientists can use for 3D data exploration and as their everyday 2D computer monitor. This implementation is based on an autostereoscopic dynamic parallax barrier 2D / 3D display, interactive input devices. This paper will describe the my contributions to the hardware construction, software components, and its implementation as a platform for nanoscale materials science exploration.<br><br>
