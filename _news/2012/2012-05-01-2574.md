Actual final Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) outcome ratings for end-of-life patients with pain diagnoses.

We report findings on the current state of pain care in hospitals for end-of-life (EOL) patients using longitudinal data from eight diverse medical-surgical units located in 4 different Midwestern hospitals over 24 months. We identified 1,425 EOL care episodes, 596 (41.3%) of which had a pain diagnosis. The percentage of EOL patients with pain varied significantly across units (p<.001), and was even lower (27.7%) for those with &ldquo;acute confusion.&rdquo; Additionally, 30% of EOL patients had severe or significant pain at death or discharge to hospice and only 42.7% actually met the expected pain related outcome ratings. Pain often improved within 48 hours of admission (p<.005), the improvement, however, stagnated following this initial time period (p=.92). A sizable gap between pain science and clinical practice continues.
