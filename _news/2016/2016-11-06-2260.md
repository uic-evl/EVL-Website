Mixed presence collaboration using the dataduplication technique. The yellow highlight in each photo shows the shared portal on each shared display with synchronized applications and pointer icons.

Real world group-to-group collaboration often occurs between partially distributed interdisciplinary teams, with each discipline working in a unique environment suited for its needs. Groupware must be flexible so that it can be incorporated into a variety of workspaces in order to successfully facilitate this type of mixed presence collaboration. We have developed two new techniques for sharing and synchronizing multi-user applications between heterogeneous large-scale shared displays. The first new technique partitions displays into a perfectly mirrored public space and a local private space. The second new technique enables user-controlled partial synchronization, where different attributes of an application can be synchronized or controlled independently. This paper presents two main contributions of our work: 1) identifying deficiencies in current groupware for interacting with data during mixed presence collaboration, and 2) developing two multi-user data synchronization techniques to address these deficiencies and extend current collaborative infrastructure for large-scale shared displays.<br><br>
