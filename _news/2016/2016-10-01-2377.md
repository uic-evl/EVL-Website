Head and neck cancer treatment and toxicity Big Data collected at U Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; jointly analyzed at EVL, MDACC, UMN and Iowa.

Radiomics involves the application of image processing algorithms to define a series of quantitative image characteristics. We sought to develop a clinically usable radiomics signature for primary oropharyngeal cancers (OPC), using the gross tumor volume (GTV) regions of interest (ROIs) to derive a &ldquo;phenotypic profile&rdquo; associated with time to local recurrence (LR).<br><br>
