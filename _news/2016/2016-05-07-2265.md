A screencast from a performance with Monad v0.1 [6], which utilized a client-driven rewarding mechanism.

In this paper, we investigate methods for improving networked musical collaboration by introducing game mechanics to musical performance. We present a novel audiovisual performance system, where multiple users contribute to an over-the-network performance that is mediated by a variety of game-like rules. User evaluations and audience feedback collected in both private performance and public concert contexts indicate the potential of game-like music environments for improving musical interaction and listener attention in networked computer music performances.<br><br>
