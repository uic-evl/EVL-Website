This essay reformulates the question of human augmentation as a problem of advanced human-machine communication, theorizing that such communication implies robust artificial intelligence and necessitates understanding the relational role new technologies play in human-machine communication. We focus on the questions, &ldquo;When do electronic tools cease to be &rsquo;simply&rsquo; tools, and become meaningfully part of ourselves,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;When might we think of these tools as augmenting our selves, rather than simply amplifying our capabilities?&rdquo; These questions, already important to the medical and rehabilitative fields, loom larger with increasing commodification of pervasive augmentation technologies, and indicate the verge on which human-machine
communication now finds itself. Through analyses of human and machine agency, mediated through a theory of close human-machine communication, we argue that the critical element in discussions of human-machine communication is an increase in sense of agency, extending the traditional human-computer interface dictum to provide an internal locus of control.<br><br>
