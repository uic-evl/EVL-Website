Presentation of the project using the Xbox controller at Litteraturhuset Oslo, Norway

&ldquo;Hearts and Minds: The Interrogations Project&rdquo; is an interactive performance made for the CAVE2&trade; large-scale 320-degree panoramic virtual reality environment that describes veterans&rsquo; testimonies about military interrogations in Iraq during the American counter-insurgency campaign. The project is based on interviews of American soldiers and on their actual testimonies. The project was achieved through technical innovation, cross-disciplinary and international collaboration. It was developed using a novel method for direct output of the Unity-based virtual reality projects into the CAVE2 environment. Other portable versions of the work were developed to reach new audiences across educational, arts and public arenas which include (1) personal computer version navigable using Xbox 360 controller; (2) web-based version available for free download; (3) Oculus Rift immersive virtual reality HMD version; (4) mobile version of the project for Apple iPad (in progress). This paper describes the development and compares the interaction experiences across platforms.<br><br>
