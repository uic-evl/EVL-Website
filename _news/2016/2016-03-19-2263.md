Node Kara is an audiovisual mixed reality installation by the artist Anıl Camci. It offers a body-based interaction using a 3D imaging of the exhibition space. With a blurred audiovisual scene in its steady-state, it invites visitors to interact with the multiplicity of layers it holds within. By moving in the exhibition space, the visitors can deblur both the sound and the visuals as they get immersed in the piece. Rather than a detection of discrete events or gestures, Node Kara relies on fluid interactions with continuous visual layers and stochastic audio. This way, the piece reacts to each visitor in a unique way.
