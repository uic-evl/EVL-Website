We present the design of a scalable visual tool for the analysis of high-throughput network traffic, power consumption and cluster-based system resource allocation. The tool explores the possibility of visualizing remote and distributed resources over large distances by using SAGE2, a collaborative framework for large scale display systems. Programmable networks and distributed cloud resources allow accessibility to large amounts of infrastructure data. The tool needs to present the information in an easy-to-understand format for users who do not have any prior systems or network administration experience, but still have an interest in power consumption and network traffic - such as university and city officials. We evaluate the effectiveness of the application
through user testing and feedback.<br><br>
<strong>Keywords:</strong> network traffic, power consumption, cluster-based system resource allocation, analysis, large displays.
